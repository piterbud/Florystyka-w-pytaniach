# Florystyka W Pytaniach
### Floristry In Questions

## General info
This is an educational application containing test questions for both amateur and professional florists, plus thematic video tutorials.

#### The project consists of the following sections:
* **Home page:** Here you enter your name and choose the number of test questions (5, 10 or 15). Additionally, you can enable random selection of questions.
The last option is to go to the floristic education section with videos (YouTube Data API has been used).
* **Quiz section with test questions:** Main section with questions and four answers to each of them. Some questions include supporting drawings.
In order to go to the next question just click the "next" button.
* **Test summary section:** After completing the test, you will see information about your result and receive a detailed report indicating which answers are actually correct.

All inscriptions on the website are in Polish.

#### Other features:
* Click on the header logo to return to the home page at any time.
* The application is **responsive** and can be used on desktop computers, tablets and smartphones.
* I took all the background photos myself (photography is my second passion after front-end).
